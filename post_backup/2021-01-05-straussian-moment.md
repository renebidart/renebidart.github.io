[The Straussian Moment - Peter Thiel (pdf)](https://github.com/renebidart/papers/blob/master/straussian_moment.pdf)

This was strangely hard to find and only available as pictures on Evernote, so I uploaded it as a searchable PDF. Peter Robinson also has a great [interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRleB034EC8) with Thiel on his essay.
